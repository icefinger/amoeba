# Amoeba
##Summary
Minimization algorithms using amoeba, random scanning and annealing.
The documentation can be found here: https://www.ge.infn.it/~chugon/Amoeba/html/

The examples on how to use each of the methods are in programs/test_*.cxx

##Compilation:

Amoeba uses cmake. It has only the standard libraries (c++11) as dependency:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
